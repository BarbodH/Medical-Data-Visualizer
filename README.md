# Tasks
Create a chart similar to `examples/Figure_1.png`, where we show the counts of good and bad outcomes for the `cholesterol`, `gluc`, `alco`, `active`, and `smoke` variables for patients with cardio=1 and cardio=0 in different panels.

Use the data to complete the following tasks in `medical_data_visualizer.py`:

* Add an `overweight` column to the data. To determine if a person is overweight, first calculate their BMI by dividing their weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. If that value is > 25 then the person is overweight. Use the value 0 for NOT overweight and the value 1 for overweight.
* Normalize the data by making 0 always good and 1 always bad. If the value of `cholesterol` or `gluc` is 1, make the value 0. If the value is more than 1, make the value 1.
* Convert the data into long format and create a chart that shows the value counts of the categorical features using seaborn's `catplot()`. The dataset should be split by 'Cardio' so there is one chart for each `cardio` value. The chart should look like `examples/Figure_1.png`.
* Clean the data. Filter out the following patient segments that represent incorrect data:
    * diastolic pressure is higher than systolic (Keep the correct data with `(df['ap_lo'] <= df['ap_hi'])`)
    * height is less than the 2.5th percentile (Keep the correct data with `(df['height'] >= df['height'].quantile(0.025))`)
    * height is more than the 97.5th percentile
    * weight is less than the 2.5th percentile
    * weight is more than the 97.5th percentile
* Create a correlation matrix using the dataset. Plot the correlation matrix using seaborn's `heatmap()`. Mask the upper triangle. The chart should look like `examples/Figure_2.png`.

Unit tests are written for you under test_module.py.
